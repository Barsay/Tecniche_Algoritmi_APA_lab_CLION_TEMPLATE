# Tecniche_Algoritmi_APA_lab_CLION_TEMPLATE
Hello! This repository is currently a work in progress. Something could not work as expected

## What is this
This is a *not official* CMake template, intended to quickly setup your lab projects, in the Politecnico di Torino courses for *APA* (deprecated course), *Tecniche di Programmazione*,  *Algoritmi e Strutture Dati*. <br>

It is intended to be used with CLion, but if you feel brave you can use it without a GUI.
